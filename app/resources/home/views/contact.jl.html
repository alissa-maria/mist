<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>I don't have my e-mail service set up yet (probably shouldn't be too difficult, but you know).</p>

<p>But if you somehow found this website, you probably know me personally anyway. So if you really need to reach me you
    can just send me a text message or come to my house or whatever.</p>
