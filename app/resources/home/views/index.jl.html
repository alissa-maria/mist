<p><strong>Welcome to my</strong> little corner of the web, where I share my creations and findings
    about the arts, engineering, and other stuff. I intend to be as true to myself and my interests as possible
    â€” oh, how corny this might become . . .</p>

<p>I'm hosting this website myself, with a webserver I set up in Julia, built on the <a
        href="https://genieframework.com/">Genie Framework</a>. Before I hosted a static website on <a
        href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, which was also fun, but if you're a software/system
    engineer, I'd really recommend fiddling with your a server of your own! I'm a big supporter of the
    independent web and <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">preserving your own creative
        content</a>. And next to that, this website is inspired by modern tech blogs, Dutch columnist/poetry
    websites and <a href="https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/">digital gardens</a>.</p>

<p>I still have to learn a lot regarding web development and creating content. I hope you'll enjoy snooping
    around, and getting a little glimspe of my journey.</p>
