<p><strong>Welcome to my</strong> little corner of the web, where I share my creations and findings
    about the arts, engineering, and other stuff. I intend to be as true to myself and my interests as possible
    — oh, how corny this might become . . .</p>

<p>I'm hosting this website myself, with a webserver I set up in Julia, built on the <a
        href="https://genieframework.com/">Genie Framework</a>. Before I hosted a static website on <a
        href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, which was also fun, but if you're a software/system
    engineer, I'd really recommend fiddling with your a server of your own! I'm a big supporter of the
    independent web and <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">preserving your own creative
        content</a>. And next to that, this website is inspired by modern tech blogs, Dutch columnist/poetry
    websites and <a href="https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/">digital gardens</a>.</p>

<p>I still have to learn a lot regarding web development and creating content. I hope you'll enjoy snooping
    around, and getting a little glimspe of my journey.</p>

<h2>my 2023 focus for art</h2>

<div class="img-box">
    <a href="/img/illustrations/wander.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-title="Wander and Phalanx (January 11th, 2021)">
        <img src="/img/illustrations/wander.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</div>

<p><strong>Above this paragraph</strong> is a drawing I made for a dear friend of mine about two
    years ago — it's a piece of fan art based on the 13th colossus, Phalanx, from the game Shadow of the
    Colossus. It's not my best piece, I even find some parts, like the ground, rather silly, but I like how back
    then I was more daring to try out new techniques.</p>

<p>In 2022, I started the year with the goal to draw things that I love. This resulted in me drawing a bunch of
    portraits and guitars, which is cool, but I was ultimately just noodling around. This year I want to focus
    on big environments. Video games with "lonely" environments (think Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us,
    Shadow of the Colossus and Portal 2) inspire me <em>a lot</em>, so painting fan art will be a good starting
    point. (Next to replaying some of them ;-)</p>
