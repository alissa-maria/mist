**Above this paragraph** is a drawing I made for a friend of mine about two years ago â€” it's a piece of fan art based on the 13th colossus, Phalanx, from the game Shadow of the Colossus. It's not my best piece, I even find some parts, like the ground, rather silly, but I like how back then I was more daring to try out new techniques.

In 2022, I started the year with the goal to draw things that I love. This resulted in me drawing a bunch of portraits and guitars, which is cool, but I was ultimately just noodling around. This year I want to focus on big environments. Video games with "lonely" environments (think Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us, Shadow of the Colossus and Portal 2) inspire me _a lot_, so painting fan art will be a good starting point. (Next to replaying some of them ;-)
