            <p>for digital art i either use paint tool sai 2 or procreate.</p>
            <p> for traditional art i use micron fineliners and whatever sketchbook is laying around.</p>

            <p>i love drawing characters with their expressions and gestures. i try to make my drawings look alive, or
                warm. right now i'm learning to become better at painting, so i can apply this knowledge to my newer drawings, even
                when i'm drawing in a cartoon style.</p>
                <!-- <p>the main goal i have in general with my drawings is to make something "warm". it doesn't <em>have</em> to be technically good; as long as it makes the viewer feel something. some of my newer drawings are however rather static, because i'm trying to get better at painting. i hope to combine this painterly style with my own lively, cartoony style.</p> -->
                <!-- <p>i never had formal art classes, so i'm just winging it most of the time. i do place a lot of value on learning from the masters. in the future i'll make a post with all of my learning resources (modern and classic).</p> -->
